Recurrent and convolutional neural networks for digits recognition

Here added code for Recurrent neural network and Convolutional neural network with 3 hidden layers.
Best accuracy of this CNN model is 98,39%
Convolutional neural network model is saved and reused for simple digits recognition and for numbers recognition which are combined of more than one digit.
Passed parameters to the main function are image and number of digits in it.
Then image is divided into pieces, depending on provided parameter value.
And then each new image is resized to 28x28 and sended to model for prediction.
Comments between lines is in Lithuanian language.
