Recurrent and convolutional neural networks for digits recognition

Here added code for Recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network with 3 hidden layers.
Convolutional neural network model is saved and reused for simple digits recognition and for numbers which are combined of multiple digits recognition.
Passed parameters are image and number of digits in it. Then depending on number of digits image is divided into that much pieces, depending on number of digits. And then each new image is resized to 28x28 and sended to model to predict.
